### Outline:

A â€œhot market"(hotness) is a real estate market with low inventory combined with lots of buyers looking for the perfect place.
For this project, our goal is to compare housing inventory (count), price point($) and property tax(%) among the two cities Dallas, Tx and Austin,Tx & determine which is more desirable based on these three factors. We will support our conclusion using visualization and metrics derived from the analysis.

### Question:

### Factors used for comparison
* House availability
* Pricing
* Property tax

### Datasets to be used:
Time period of data used for analysis :  2015 to till date
